# WindowsFormsDelegateDemo
This is an example of C# desktop windows application where control properties can be set from child class.
I have done this because:
 1.	The C# gods not believe children should be able to talk to there parents without shouting such that everyone can hear.
 2.	All examples for the use of delegates use console apps, so I took one and converted it.
 3.	I am sick of get all sorts “not accessible” or and “protection level” messages from the C# gods
